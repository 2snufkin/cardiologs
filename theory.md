# EKG Entities
In the context of cardiac electrophysiology, the normal rhythm of the heart involves a series of electrical events that 
produce characteristic patterns on an electrocardiogram (ECG). These events are associated with the contraction and relaxation 
of different parts of the heart muscle.

1. **P Wave**:
   - The P wave represents atrial depolarization, which is the electrical stimulation that causes the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) to contract. 
   - This wave indicates that the electrical impulse originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart's natural pacemaker, has propagated through the atria, causing them to contract and pump blood into the ventricles.

2. **QRS Complex**:
   - The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization, which is the electrical stimulation that causes the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) to contract.
   - This complex indicates that the electrical impulse has spread through the ventricles, resulting in their contraction and the ejection of blood into the arteries.

3. **T Wave**:
   - The T wave represents ventricular repolarization, which is the process by which the ventricles recover from the electrical stimulation and prepare for the next heartbeat.
   - This wave indicates that the ventricles are relaxing and returning to their resting state after contraction.

4. **U Wave**:
   - The U wave represents papillary muscle repolarization, which is the repolarization of the papillary muscles located in the ventricles.
   - Papillary muscles are involved in the functioning of the heart valves (particularly the mitral and tricuspid valves). The U wave is not always visible on an ECG and may be more prominent in certain individuals or under specific conditions.

## What about atrial repolarization?
Atrial repolarization generally occurs  during the early part of the QRS complex or immediately following it. 
However, atrial repolarization is not typically visible on the ECG due to its smaller magnitude compared to the ventricular electrical activity.
